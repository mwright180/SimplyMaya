        My name is Maya, and I'm a 28-year-old Air Force veteran origianlly from South Carolina. Staying active is important to me, and I enjoy spending time at the gym-it helps me keep my mind and body operating at their best. I have a dog named Gizmo and I love him so much. I also love spending time at the beach and helping others in any way I can and find purpose in uplifting those around me.
