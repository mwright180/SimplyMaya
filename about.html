        Hey hey! I’m a small-town girl born and raised in South Carolina (and when I say small, I mean one grocery store, one Dollar General, and two gas stations kind of small). My high school graduating class? Just 70 people. Everyone knew everyone. But honestly, growing up in a tight-knit community taught me the power of showing up for others, because someone was always there to help.
    <p>After high school (shoutout to being voted Most Athletic Female), I gave college a try but eventually followed a different path—straight into the Air Force. It was one of the best decisions I’ve made. Tough? For sure…Worth it? 100%. The experience taught me discipline, resilience, and just how far I could push myself.
Life had a different plan, though. My military career was cut short when I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Suddenly, my go-go-go lifestyle hit pause, and I had to learn how to listen to my body at 24 years-old even when my heart was screaming, “You’ve got this!” It’s been a journey—physically, emotionally, mentally—but I’m still here, still strong, and still smiling.</p>     
 
     <p>Fast forward to now, I’m currently working with the government as a Security Specialist. </p>
